Our project is an interactive 3D orrery web app that visualizes the Solar System and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), including asteroids, comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). We used Blender to create detailed models of celestial bodies such as planets, asteroids, and moons, which were then integrated into the web app for a rich, realistic experience. This interactive platform allows users to explore planetary orbits and NEO trajectories while zooming in and out, controlling the simulation speed, and toggling different celestial bodies on and off.

To ensure the accuracy of our visualizations, we used NASA‚Äôs public space data to set the orbital parameters of planets and NEOs, such as their Keplerian elements. This data enabled us to accurately model the orbit paths, eccentricities, and inclinations of the celestial bodies. We also leveraged NASA‚Äôs CNEOS database to visualize real-time and future close approaches of NEOs to Earth. The app highlights the importance of monitoring PHAs, showcasing their proximity to Earth in a visually striking and informative way.

Our web app goes beyond simple planetary visualization by providing interactive features for users to control the timeline, speed, and display of specific NEOs and PHAs. The tool serves both as an educational platform to raise awareness about the dynamics of the Solar System and as a potential aid for planetary defence by showcasing how close NEOs come to Earth. Future enhancements include real-time notifications for potential asteroid threats and more advanced exploration modes, making this project a powerful tool for understanding space risks and possibilities.

Our project is built using a robust tech stack designed to deliver both accuracy and interactivity. We created the 3D models and textures for planets and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using Blender, ensuring detailed and realistic visualizations. These models were then integrated into the web app using Three.js for rendering and interaction. We relied on NASA‚Äôs public space data in JSON format to accurately map orbits and planetary spacing, ensuring scientific precision. The project is powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional NASA API integration to provide real-time data for celestial bodies, making the experience both educational and dynamic.
